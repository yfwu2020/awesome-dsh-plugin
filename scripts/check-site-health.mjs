// Catch a site that quietly stopped being deployed.
//
// The freeze this guards against left no trace anywhere: from 2026-09-09 to
// 2026-09-25 every scheduled `build-site` run failed, and dshmarket.com kept
// serving the 2026-09-08 catalog the whole time — 3,363 plugin pages live
// against 4,347 in the catalog, so 1,082 plugins simply had no page. Nothing
// failed loudly, because nothing watched the thing that actually went stale:
// the deployed bytes.
//
// So this reads the live site rather than CI's own report. That also covers a
// failure no log can show — a schedule that stops running altogether, which is
// what GitHub does to a scheduled workflow after 60 days of repository
// inactivity. One signal, measured end to end.
//
// The site must carry a plugin link for every entry its catalog holds. It is
// allowed to be `tolerance` entries behind, because entries land between a
// build and this check: measured 2026-09-03..09-25 the catalog grew 62.5
// entries/day on average, 205 on its busiest day. 300 therefore rides out a
// burst, and still catches a freeze inside its first week rather than its
// third.
//
// Usage:
//   node scripts/check-site-health.mjs --live <url> --catalog-url <url> [--tolerance N]
//   node scripts/check-site-health.mjs --live <url> --catalog-dir <dir> [--tolerance N]
//
// Use --catalog-dir when the catalog is built and published by the same run
// that builds the pages: comparing that site against its own published catalog
// would compare it against itself, so the repository is the truth instead.
//
// Exits 1 with the numbers and the reason on every failure, a fetch error
// included: "could not check" must never be mistaken for "all good".
